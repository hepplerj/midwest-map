# Participation Guidelines

This project follows these guidelines to cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers, and vendors.

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity

Theis project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

## Raising Issues at #mozsprint

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices with this project which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact the project lead, Jason Heppler <jheppler@unomaha.edu>.

The project leads reserve the right to refuse admission to anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the event.

## Working in the Open

Because working open is one of the project's core values, Mapping Midwest program planning is done in the open on Github. We hope participants will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration, and will continue to work with an open ethos in their own projects.
